	<p>
	Write a JavaScript program to calculate the factorial of a number. <br>
	In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120

	<script>
		function calculateFactorial(number){
			var result = number;
			if (result === 0){
				return 1;
			}
			else{
				for ( var i = number-1; i > 0; i-- ){
					result = result * i;
				}
				return result;
			}
		}
		
		console.log(calculateFactorial(5));
